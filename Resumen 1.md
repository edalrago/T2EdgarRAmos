# Phyton si beconming the worlds most popular coding language

“I CERTAINLY didn’t set out to create a language that was intended for mass consumption,” says Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer scientist who devised Python, a programming language, in 1989.
But nearly three decades on, his invention has overtaken almost all of its 
rivals and brought coding to the fingrertips of peple whoe were once baffled by it.
the languages two main advantages are its simplicyty and flexibility. its straightforward syntax
With such a rapidly growing user base and wide array of capabilities, Python might seem destined to become the lingua franca of coding, rendering all other competitors obsolete. That is unlikely, according to Grady Booch, IBM’s chief software scientist, who compares programming languages to empires.
