# Programming language of the year? Python is standout in latest rankings

Python gained 3.62 percentage points year over year in Tiobe's January 2019 index, beating rises by Visual Basic .NET and Java, the second and third biggest gainers. Python was created in 1989 by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum, who relinquished his role as Python's 'Benevolent dictator for life' in July. 
Python entered the top three in Tiobe's popularity index in September, thanks to its use in a growing number of fields. As Tiobe notes, it's often the first language taught at universities and it's the go-to language for statistical analysis, machine learning, scripting, web programming, and scientific computing. 
It's also the most popular language with hackers, thanks to its easy-to-grasp syntax, broad availability of online tutorials, and an abundance of harmless third-party software libraries that can be repurposed for malicious use.    
The Tiobe index and other popularity rankings from IEEE Spectrum and PYPL offer programmers a way to assess which languages are worth investing time into. ZDNet's David Gewirtz has written a highly informative piece on how developers can approach this question using a variety of indexes and sources other than popularity rankings.
